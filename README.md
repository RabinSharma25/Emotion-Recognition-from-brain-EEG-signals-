# Emotion-Recognition-from-brain-EEG-signals-
Emotion recognition can be achieved by obtaining signals from the brain by EEG . This test records the activity of the brain in form of waves. We have used DEAP dataset on which we are classifying the emotion as valance, likeness/dislike, arousal, dominance. We have used LSTM and CNN classifier which gives 88.60 % and 87.72% respectively (BEST among others) accuracy to predict the model successfully.

DEAP dataset can be found on the official website.
